                                Dentists are trained professionals who help care for the teeth and mouth.

                                A dentist has many responsibilities, and one of the most important is
                                promoting good dental hygiene. This helps to prevent complications in your mouth or other parts of
                                the body.

                                A dentist also diagnoses and treats problems of the gums, teeth, and mouth.
                                Dentists use modern technology and equipment like X-ray machines, lasers, drills, brushes,
                                scalpels, and other medical tools when performing dental procedures. They also wear protective
                                equipment like gloves, masks, and safety glasses to prevent the spread of germs or bacteria.
